MAJOR TODO: RECODE 2016 DATA TO TRULY REFLECT ONLY TRUE DEFEATS AND TRUE WINS (WHERE MARGIN < 10 PERCENTAGE POINTS).

THIS INVOLVES MAKING SURE THE defeat.true variable is appropriately coded.

MAJOR ISSUE: BALANCE TABLE, FOR RDD SAMPLE, IS INCORRECT. THE STD DIFF IN MEANS WERE WRONGLY CALCULATED TO BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT SHOULD BE. 


MAY NEED TO REVERT BACK TO OLD MODEL THAT DOES NOT USE TRUE DEFEATS AND TRUE WINS


For 2011

- lfe results do not work: negative effect, statistically insignificant
- rdd results:
    + At threshold of 63, do not work: negative effect, statistically insignificant. 
	    + placebo gives no significant results >> no reason to claim that data is bad
    + At threshold of 58, do not work: negative effect close to zero, statistically insignificant
	    + one out of 3 placebo gives significant results >> at least there's a reason to claim data is bad
	    + threshold of 58 is achievable if remove Hanoi and HCMC prior to threshold selection
		  x but doing this kills the 2016 result, so better not do it
- synth results
    + Small positive and significant (at .1 level) detected at t+3
    + placebo gives significant results >> good reason to claim that
    data is bad
- balance is good for both lme and rdd samples (even better than for the 2016 results)
    + again, no reason to claim that data is bad...
- results do not change even after new coding of central nominees

- plotting graphicaly however there are reasons to say that placebos are not good
    + for lfe, treatment at t-2 is positive not statistically significant but strong
    + for rdd, same thing, but at least one specification is statistically significant
    + for synth, significant and clear negative placebo difference

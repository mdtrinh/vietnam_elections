official
in

public
opinion

claims
that
it

9

surveys
a

admits
that
they
are
not
large-scale
surveys

can

Instead,
it

Some
observers
suspect
that
the
regime
may
want
some
of
these
candidates
to
lose,
for
example
to
project
the
image
of
truly
competitive
elections
\citep
{Morgenbesser2016}.
The
CPV,
however,
has
never
tied
its
legitimacy
to
claims
about
electoral
competitiveness
in
official
narratives.
Citizens
themselves
overwhelmingly
stated
that
they
do
not
believe
elections
to
be
even
remotely
competitive
(personal

Depending
on
population
size,
each
district
can
have
4,
5
or
6
candidates,
and
is
allowed
2,
3,
or
4
VNA
seats.
Each
voter
votes
for
as
many
candidates
as
there
are
seats.
The
candidates
with
the
most
votes
win
as
long
as
their
vote
shares
exceed
50
percent.
Central
candidates
could
lose
if
too
many
of
the
local
candidates
win
too
much
of
the
vote
share,
or
if
they
themselves
fail
to
secure
approval
from
at

half
of
the
voters.
Either
outcome
is
less
likely
in
districts
with
5
candidates,
as
their
seat-to-candidates
ratio
of
$0.6$
is
more

ironically
stems

\citet

remarks
that
the
NDP
in
Egypt
can
use
elections
to
both
identify
opposition
stronghold
and
to
detect
disloyal
ruling
party
members
who
mobilized
for
the
opposition,
these
two
motivations
may
not
be
compatible
if
the
punishment
needed
to
suppress
opposition
districts
would
also
wound
up
hurting
loyal
party
members
in
these
districts
and
thus
discouraging
their
loyalty.
Thus,
evidence
of
indiscriminate
forms
of
punishment
may
suggest
that
the
party
prioritizes
identifying
opposition
areas.
\citet
{Morgenbesser2016}
argues
that
electoral
autocracies
in
Southeast
Asia
conduct
elections
for
legitimation
but
not
for
any
informational
goal.
This
could
be
tested
by
observing
whether
these
regimes
respond
to
low
winning
vote
shares
by
intensifying
manipulation
in
future
elections,
because
doing
so
only
reduces
elections'
informational
value.

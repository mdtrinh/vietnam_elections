\title{Tea Leaf Elections: \\
	Inferring Purpose for Authoritarian Elections from Post-election Responses to Defeats}
\author{Minh Trinh}



\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Although authoritarian elections can help dictators maintain their rule in many different ways, their power are not unlimited. To ensure that elections do their jobs optimally, rational dictators must be judicious in choosing which objectives they want each election to fulfill, such that they prioritize some functions of authoritarian elections over others. Specifically, when using elections to gather information, authoritarian regimes must decide which specific type of information they need, and optimize elections to provide signal on only that type of information. This is so that the information that election results reveal and the policy actions they recommend are consistent with each other and with the original intention for holding authoritarian elections. Given this insight, it is possible to identify the type of information each regime seeks to receive from its elections by studying its reactions to unexpected defeats in parliamentary elections, which do not pose existential threat but are still alarming enough to warrant reactions. Applying this logic to the case of Vietnam, I find that the ruling Communist Party of Vietnam responded to the defeats of its favored candidates in the 2016 election for the national legislature by increasing central transfers to provinces with these defeats to boost development expenditure there. This evidence suggests that the regime uses elections as an opinion poll to identify areas it is less popular in, instead of as an evaluation device to identify local leaders who under-perform in their electoral mobilization efforts.

\section{Introduction}

At first glance, authoritarian elections seem to be an all-powerful weapon in the dictator's arsenal: not only do they rarely pose existential threats, these elections also serve to cement autocrats' rule by providing critical information on many variables otherwise unknowable by these autocrats. The literature that discusses authoritarian elections' many informational functions, however, has not considered potential conflict between them. Specifically, an election that is designed to provide information on some variables may become less effective at shedding light on some others. This forces authoritarian rulers to set priorities and use elections as a telescope focused on a few variables of interest, rather than a panoramic camera that collects all the information that comes into view.

Using the case of Vietnam, I show that the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) needs information on both the sub-national distribution of regime support and on the quality of its local officials; national elections can offer information on either variable, but the CPV chooses to use it to shed light on the former. Specifically, I take advantage of rare and unexpected defeats by regime-favored candidates in Vietnam's 2016 legislative election, defeats that the regime did not want to suffer, but still did not do everything it could to avoid. Using publicly-available budget data, I show that the CPV increased central transfers from Hanoi to provinces it has suffered defeats in. This robust finding is produced by three different empirical methods, and is consistent with the hypothesis that the Party saw these defeats as indicators for pockets of disillusioned citizens and spent money to placate them. It also rejects the hypothesis that the regime used election defeats to identify provinces with under-performing local officials, because under this hypothesis the CPV would have wanted to punish officials in these provinces. The increased central transfers would accomplish only the opposite.

While its empirical evidence draws heavily from a single country case, especially from \citepos{MaleskySchuler2011} detailed description of Vietnam's electoral system, this paper does engage with the larger literature on authoritarian elections. Its main theoretical contribution is to demonstrate how existing theories may not coexist within some certain cases -- specifically those that portray elections as the autocrats opinion poll \citep[e.g.][]{Miller2015, Magaloni2006, Blaydes2008} and those that portray them as a test to evaluate regime agents \citep[e.g.][]{Magaloni2006, Blaydes2008,Myagkov2009,RundlettSvolik2016}. In addition, it offers a framework to identify dictators' goals for elections and test theories of authoritarian elections by considering post-election responses to localized defeats. Finally, the empirical finding suggests that even rulers of highly stable authoritarian regimes in Vietnam may still respond to public dissatisfaction, suggesting possible pathways for accountability through formal authoritarian institutions.

\section{The Limits of Authoritarian Elections}
\label{sec:theory_limits}

Why do some authoritarian regimes choose to hold elections, and then allow less-than-satisfactory results to happen, when they could have gotten away without it? The literature on authoritarian elections has proposed that holding elections may bring certain benefits for the authoritarian leaders, to the extent that some dictators may rationally accept electoral risks in order to secure these benefits.\footnote{\cite[See][for some of the most seminal works in this literature]{Geddes2005, LustOkar2006, AR2005, Magaloni2006, Blaydes2008, Miller2015, Cox2009}} Most commonly, this literature shows that authoritarian elections provide dictators with information they cannot otherwise obtain, such as about their opponents' strength \citep{Geddes2005}, the existence of potential individual threats or allies \citep{LustOkar2005}, the competence or loyalty of their own agents \citep{Magaloni2006, Blaydes2008, Myagkov2009, RundlettSvolik2016}, the citizenry's \textit{level} of dissatisfaction with the regime \citep{Miller2015} or even its \textit{distribution} across sub-national units \citep{Magaloni2006, Blaydes2008, Reed2001}. All this information then contributes to authoritarian longevity by allowing the regime to adjust its policies, either by suppressing emerging opposition strongholds \citep{Magaloni2006, Blaydes2008} buying off dissatisfied public \citep{Reed2001, Miller2015, Magaloni2006}, or co-opting emerging elites into the regime \citep{LustOkar2005}.

This expansive range of functions of authoritarian elections, however, cannot be served simultaneously by the same election. Indeed, an election designed to be a jack of all trades only risks becoming a master of none: the more goals a dictator seeks to accomplish through an election, the less effective it is at achieving any of them. In regard to information, dictators can only learn useful information from elections if they restrict themselves to using these elections to collect a small subset of the information that they can theoretically convey. There are at least three reasons why this is the case:

Firstly, an authoritarian regime would not be able to draw any informative conclusion from an election's outcome if there are too many potential ways a particular set of results could be interpreted. Since election outcomes are just raw numbers, for them to convey any information the dictators have to be able to connect them to variables they care about, and this requires a process of interpretation or causal attribution. For example, facing a humiliating setback in an electoral district, the regime must be able to determine whether the cause behind it is unenthusiastic regime agents not manipulating elections hard enough, or disenchanted citizens frustrated enough to risk voting against the ruling party. If the regime interprets the defeat in terms of regime agents' effort, then it would learn something about the quality of its agents; if instead it interprets the result as the product of citizen disillusionment, then the defeat would shed light on the distribution of its popularity across the country. If both interpretations are equally plausible, the regime would find it hard to decide which interpretation to commit to; even when it chooses to believe in both -- as a ``weighted mixture'' for instance -- there can be an infinite numbers of differently weighted mixtures that could explain equally well the observed result. To achieve cognitive clarity i.e. to know for sure whether an interpretation is more plausible than another, dictators must ensure that some variables cannot plausibly enter the equation, either by willfully assume away their influence, or through manipulation tactics that effectively neutralize some determinants of election results. In this sense, strategies that place rigid controls on some of the electoral process's moving parts, such as banning opposition parties or candidates, or forcing all candidates to run in districts faraway from their home, not only help dictators win elections, but also refine the information that comes out of them. These strategies, however, also eliminate the election's informational value in regard to the controlled variables. In other words, a dictator's efforts to ensure that elections send a clear signal about some type of information also disable their ability to send any other signal.

Secondly, the manipulation strategies needed to optimize the quality of multiple types of information may end up compromising other objectives beyond information. Consider again that an election's result can only be informative of any variable if that variable is allowed to influence the outcome, it is clear that there is a tension between keeping many variables loosely managed and maintaining airtight control over electoral uncertainty.\footnote{Indeed, an corollary of the ``Dictator's Dilemma'' is that excessive election fraud diminishes the informational value of elections \citep{Wintrobe2000}} In particular, while it may be possible for a regime to avoid ballot stuffing to make vote counts informative of public opinion, or to accept opposition candidate in hope that the election will reveal relevant threats, or to delegate election management to regime agents expecting the outcome to identify which agents do a better job, attempting all of them at once can expose the regime to significant risks. At best, the regime may no longer be able to secure overwhelming victories and thus fail at the demonstration objective \citep{Geddes2005}; at worse the risks may even result in electoral defeats. At the end of the day, authoritarian control over the electoral process is a finite resources that can only be spent on a limited number of informational goals before it becomes insufficient for other priorities.

Finally, a regime seeking to infer different types of information from the same election may face difficulty in making policy adjustments in reaction to all the incoming information. Even when the regime manages to harmonize all the signals coming in from the same set of election results, they may not be able to appropriately respond to all of them. Moreover, the suitable response to one information may end up contradicting that to another: in the above example, a regime perceiving election setbacks as information about incompetent regime agents may choose to punish them, but in doing so it may embolden disobedient citizens by helping them get rid of incongruent officials, an outcome the regime would not prefer if it also believes that the setbacks have revealed pockets of disloyal voters. The potential for such conflict in post-election responses is especially serious for regimes whose repertoire of actions in the post-election period is particularly limited, as in the case of low-capacity regimes, but also high-capacity regimes with highly structured institutions and low level of policy discretion.\footnote{Single-party or military regimes -- as categorized by \citet{GeddesWrightFrantz2014} -- fit particularly well this description, and so do federal or similarly hierarchical regimes.} For these regimes, seeking too much information from elections only result in contradictory policy recommendations, which debilitates more than facilitates policy responsiveness.

\subsection{Informational Limits of Vietnam's National Assembly Elections}
\label{sec:vietnam_limits}
Vietnam is a fitting showcase for these arguments. Vietnam is a single-party regime, which formally follows a parliamentary system but in practice is centrally ruled by the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV). The CPV controls the entire political system, has power over membership in both the legislature and in the executive branch, and also maintains a party bureaucracy that intertwines with the government bureaucracy at all levels of administration. Like most authoritarian regimes, the CPV needs a reliable flow of information from the citizenry and regime agents to effectively rule. Thanks to a large and deeply penetrating security apparatus, it has managed to secure most of the information other regimes would have needed elections to collect. It does not, however, have reliable sources of information on two variables: the distribution of regime support across sub-national provinces, and the quality of its subordinates at local levels of government. 

In terms of public support, the Vietnamese regime only has reasons to believe that its general \textit{level} of popularity is sufficient: the CPV benefits from a long historical legacy as the revolutionary party that brought independence from the French in 1945 and unified the country after the Vietnam War in 1975, from the recent period of high economic growth, as well as from its tight control over the media and other propaganda apparatus. Indeed, even results from international surveys such as the World Values Survey \citeyearpar{wvs} and the Asian Barometer \citeyearpar{abs} have consistently indicate very high levels of confidence in the government. At the same time, the government in Hanoi cannot be confident that its popularity is evenly \textit{distributed} among the population of more than 90 million and across a territory spanning more than 15 degree latitude. Although protests or riots are extremely rare, unrest has occasionally emerged from isolated pockets of dissatisfaction, such as in Binh Thuan in 2018, Hanoi in 2017, or Ha Tinh in 2016. 

The CPV, however, has no reliable instrument to detect such nidi of protests before they emerge. Not only are international surveys covering too few respondents to provide reliable sub-national aggregates, the regime's own attempts at studying public opinion are also inadequate.\footnote{According to my interview with an official in the Party's public opinion research unit, the Party does not conduct large-scale surveys that can be quantitatively analyzed. Instead, it relies primarily on networks of grassroot informants whose reports do not allow for effective cross-region comparisons.} In addition, the regime's other authoritarian institutions also prove insufficient: the media is largely muted by tight control, whereas reporting by local government officials are likely subjected to intentional embellishment, because these officials are also evaluated for promotion based on their ability to maintain low levels of dissent.

In terms of regime agents, the CPV lacks good information about its millions of government and party bureaucrats. Such information is crucial for Vietnam's cadre management system.\footnote{Vietnam's cadre management system is not different from China's, which has been described in details by \citet{Manion1985}} This system serves to provide regime subordinates with meritocratic promotion pathways in exchange for performance and loyalty \citep{Svolik2012}, but requires that the party can discern bureaucrats' true ability from external factors to function properly. In addition, because the central leadership in Hanoi delegates significant power to the periphery, particularly at the province level, it needs information to determine the loyalty of provincial officials. Even though Hanoi tends to appoint outsiders to serve as top officials in the provinces, local interests still exert significant influence, particularly through the rank-and-file bureaucrats who are often native to the locality they serve in.\footnote{The distinction between two types of government agents is closely linked to the distinction between ``deployed'' and ``delegated'' bureaucrats made by \citet{Soifer2015}} Without close monitoring, even the appointed officials may collude with local actors to implement policies in ways that serve their interests instead of the center. 

Existing instruments, however, offer reliable information on neither the competence nor the loyalty of these officials. On one hand, the primarily outcome- and output-based measures that make up official reporting channels do not account for variation in external factors that make achievements inherently incomparable across sub-national units. On the other hand, sub-national officials have both the incentive and the capacity to misreport the very indicators they are evaluated on.

\subsection{VNA Elections as Plausible Information Gathering Tools}

Given the CPV's difficulty in obtaining reliable information on both the distribution of its popularity as well as the quality of individual regime agents, it seems plausible that it may turn to elections for solutions. Indeed, there are evidence that the elections for the legislature, the Vietnam National Assembly (VNA), are capable of shedding light on either of these variables.

At first glance, the VNA elections have important non-informational goals to fulfill. Occurring every four to five years, these elections would fill the approximately 500 seats in the country's national legislature from a pool of roughly 800 candidates. Nearly a quarter of these candidates are minister-level officials in central-level party or government institutions, current VNA subcommittee members, or national leaders of state-sanctioned mass organizations. Prior to the election day they are allocated to local-level electoral districts, where they run alongside local candidates who are often province-level officials, heads of local chapters of mass organizations, local business leaders or other elites. Whereas some local candidates are always expected to lose, the CPV strongly prefers central candidates to win, both because they are key party leaders for whom defeat would be embarrassing, but also because the constitution requires them to have secured seats in the VNA to hold high-level government positions.

Additionally, before each election, the central party leadership in the outgoing VNA also draws up a structure of what the next legislature should look like, down to specific quotas along demographic, political and functional lines. For instance, the planned structure for the VNA in the 2007 election called for 150 women, 90 members of ethnic minorities, 160 incumbents, 70 under-40 delegates, and 50 non-party members  \citep[506]{MaleskySchuler2011}. The Party must then use the tools at its disposal to ensure that the elected candidates together form a legislature as close to the planned structure as possible.

In light of these non-informational objectives, the first indicator that the VNA elections are designed to serve yet some other informational goals is that the regime does not seem to utilize every possible item in their ``menu of manipulations'' \citep[to quote][]{Schedler2002menu} to get the results they want. Particularly, as described by \citet{MaleskySchuler2011} and others \citep[e.g][]{Gainsborough2005}, the CPV relies mostly on electioneering and mass mobilization, both of which occurs prior to the election day, rather than heavy-handed tactics such as vote-buying or ballot stuffing.\footnote{\citet{MaleskySchuler2011} conduct Benford's test and find that the 2007 results do not demonstrate any suspicious pattern that would have been expected if there were any post-hoc manipulation. In the Online Appendix I replicate the same findings for the 2011 and 2016 elections.}

The CPV's electioneering efforts rely primarily on its control of candidate lists in electoral districts. Firstly, it filters out most independent and self-nominated candidates who are deemed to pose serious threats. Secondly, it allocates most central candidates to districts with the most favorable candidate-to-seat ratios.\footnote{Depending on population sizes, each district can have 4, 5 or 6 candidates, and is allowed 2, 3, or 4 VNA seats. Each voter votes for as many candidates as there are seats, meaning that the total vote share within a district can range from 200 to 400 percent, but each candidate can secure 100 percent at most. In all districts, the candidates with the most votes win as long as their vote shares exceed 50 percent. As a result of this setup, some central candidates could lose if too many of the local candidates win too much of the vote share, or if they themselves fail to secure the approval of at least half of the voters. This outcome is considerably less likely in districts with 5 candidates, as the seat-to-candidates ratio of $0.6$ in these districts are much more favorable than the $0.5$ ratio in other districts.} Thirdly, within these districts, central candidates face only local candidates with weaker profiles, and typically do not have to face other central candidates to avoid splitting votes. Finally, the party bunches candidates with similar profiles together in each district, e.g. by making all under-40 women run against each other, such that no matter which candidate wins the winner still fits the same profile quota.\footnote{All these details come from \citep{MaleskySchuler2011}} As a result, even individual candidates may compete against each other, central candidates normally come out on top, and the aggregate structure of the VNA is also guaranteed. 

In addition to electioneering, the CPV also conducts a massive mobilization campaign prior to and even on election day. As part of this campaign, cadres at the neighborhood or village level visit individual households to educate voters about the election process. During these visits, the cadres would give explicit ``suggestions'' about which candidates to vote for.\footnote{Personal observations, Ha Noi, 2011}\footnote{Personal interviews, Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, 2016-2017} On election day, the same cadres would visit the households again to convince people to go vote, and even carry mobile ballot boxes to those unable to come to the polling station themselves.

These strategies are able to deliver election results very close to what the regime expects: in all the recent elections, the structure of the elected VNA has always been nearly identical to what Hanoi plans,\footnote{See Table 1 in \citep[506][prefix]{MaleskySchuler2011} for  details} and most central candidates end up getting elected, usually with large vote margins and near-universal turnout.\footnote{Proxy voting, usually in the form of one person voting for the entire household, is common.} At the same time, these results are not perfect. Most importantly, a small number of central candidates -- 21 out of 165 for 2007, 14 out of 173 for 2011, and 16 out of 197 for 2016 -- lose elections, and their defeats were surprising and disappointing enough that even the state-controlled media has to cover them \citep[e.g.][]{vov2016, laodong2016}. Certainly, a degree of electoral risk still exists in Vietnam's tightly managed elections.

Given that Vietnam's leaders still refrain from some of the most overt forms of manipulation even when they could afford them, it is reasonable to suspect that the regime intentionally tolerates some electoral risk in exchange for information. This is consistent with \citepos{Wintrobe2000} observation that authoritarian regimes face a trade-off between risk and information, and with my prior argument that information-gathering through elections requires giving up some control over the process.

Moreover, some of the CPV's strategies could be seen as attempts not only to exert control, but also to refine the range of plausible interpretations for the incoming results. For example, because most central candidates do not get assigned to provinces they have served in or even to their home province, the results reflect neither their past performance nor their individual popularity among their own constituencies. The same applies -- albeit to a lesser extent -- to local candidates, who despite running in their own provinces, are still allocated to districts mostly based on which quota they may fit. Similarly, by banning most high-profile dissidents, the CPV ensures that the final tallies are not determined by voters' empathy for any particular regime opponents.

In contrast, the two variables corresponding to the CPV's two most pressing informational needs -- the local level of regime popularity and the quality of local officials -- are allowed to have oversize influence on the outcomes. To begin with, the choices on the ballots all but enable voters to channel their opinion of the regime through their votes for central candidates. Because these candidates are mostly strangers to their constituencies, the local cadres' instructions give voters plenty of cue to associate them with the central party leadership. With no other context about their performance, voters have only this association to inform their vote. At the same time, the anonymity afforded by the near-universal turnout and the secret ballot encourages voters to express dissatisfaction with the CPV without fearing of retribution.\footnote{Voters' confidence in the secret ballot ironically stems from their distrust of the tabulation of results: they think that ballots are kept secret because the regime would not even look at them, choosing instead to make up results when tabulating vote counts. Personal interviews, Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, 2016-2017} Central candidates become clear targets to direct such disapproval: among voters who willingly expressed dissatisfaction with the regime, some said they crossed out the names of whoever the local cadres instructed them to vote, whereas others said they selected only young and non-party candidates.\footnote{Personal interviews, Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City, 2016-2017}

In regard to province-level officials, the CPV allows their competence and loyalty to factor in election outcomes even when clear center-periphery conflict of interests could arise. Specifically, although central party leaders in Hanoi decide on demographic quotas for the incoming VNA and nominate central candidates, they delegate most engineering and mobilization efforts to province-level officials. It is these local officials who have discretion over candidate lists and who organize mobilization campaigns at all levels, through which they can influence the vote counts not only for both central and local candidates. Provincial officials generally find it in their interest to use this power to support central candidates, but not so eagerly that local candidates are hurt. Not only does each elected central candidate takes one VNA seat away from local candidates,\footnote{In 2016, the municipality of Hanoi reportedly demands to be allocated fewer central candidates to make room for its own candidates \citep{vnexpress2016_2}.} but central candidates who win by large margins may make some other local candidates fail the 50 percent thresholds,\footnote{In 2016, this scenario happened in two provinces \citep{vnexpress2016}} costing the province seats that they otherwise automatically have. Because many local candidates are important provincial leaders\footnote{Including the leaders of each province's party organization, executive branch and legislature, who through their position are ultimately in charge of election management in the province.} and because VNA seats give provinces representation in the legislature, provinces need to balance their support between central and local candidates. In the end, central candidates may lose if provincial officials miscalculate this balance, or if provincial officials outright promote local people at their expenses.

The CPV's inferential problem arises from the fact that any information to be gained about regime popularity and regime agents quality at the province level is both tied to the performance of central candidates allocated to each province. In other words, these candidates' performance in the VNA elections can tell the regime two different stories: bad results either suggest areas where the CPV itself is popular, or identify provincial officials who fail or intentionally refuse to do their job. \textit{A priori}, both stories seem equally plausible, and the CPV's choice of election management strategies does not clearly reveal which one they would prefer to focus on.

\section{Responses to Localized Defeats Reveal Purpose(s) of Authoritarian Elections}
\label{sec:theory_local_defeat}

Even as elections may promise multiple types of information to authoritarian regimes like Vietnam, the argument in Section \ref{sec:theory_limits} suggests that these regimes would refrain from pursuing all of them. How could outside observers know if this is true, and more importantly, how do they know which kind of information the dictators have intended to collect when ordering elections to be held, short of directly asking the dictators themselves? One approach would be to observe their \textit{a posteriori} reaction to some signal from elections, preferably when such signal is so clear and straightforward that a reaction has to be expected, and then use backward induction to determine what kind of information the dictator received from the signal that prompted them to react that way. \textit{Localized defeats} -- defeats of regime candidates in local constituencies, despite the regime's manipulation in their favor -- provide one such opportunity.

There are many reasons localized defeats can happen under authoritarian regimes, as they had in Singapore \citep{TK}, Russia \citep{TK}, or particularly Vietnam \citep{TK}. They are most likely in parliamentary elections, when a relatively large number of regime candidates run in a relatively large number of constituencies, creating many opportunities for any of them to fail. Defeats of regime candidates often result from effective strategies by the opposition \citep{BunceWolchik2010} or certain regime weaknesses \citep{LevistkyWay2010}, but even under strong authoritarian regimes they are possible. Most particularly, when dictators seek information from elections they may intentionally loosen up their control over certain aspects of the electoral process, allowing the opposition an opening.

Localized defeats are a good lens into a dictator's informational needs because they are high-information events. Since authoritarian regimes rarely suffer and thus do not expect unsatisfactory results, any defeat would provide a data point so different from their informational prior, guaranteeing that it contains more signal than noise. Indeed, even when vote shares are clouded with uncertainty and randomness, only a true aberration on the ground could lead to a regime vote share low enough to produce a defeat. Thus, if an authoritarian regime is truly using elections as a source of information, it should always pay attention to localized defeats, perhaps even more so than to vote share \textit{per se}. 

If the regime acknowledges the information from localized defeats, it should also respond with some actions -- after all, what good is \textit{information} if it does not \textit{inform} any action? At the minimum, as long as dictators prefer winning over losing to believe they would have some response to the defeats, even if only to avoid their repetition. Indeed, given that most existing theories of authoritarian elections as a source of information rest on the exact premise that regime leaders collect information from elections to calibrate their actions, these theories would also predict that they make behavioral change following the high dose of information from localized defeats. 

What response(s) a regime may have to localized defeats depends on what information it has received from the defeats, which then depends on what information they has originally sought. This logic rests on two propositions. Firstly, dictators see in elections what they look for: if they have intended for elections to shed light on certain variables of interest, then they are more likely to interpret election results in terms of that variable. In the case of the CPV, localized defeats could reveal pockets of popular discontent or the identity of under-performing regime agents, depending on what the party seeks to learn.\footnote{Neither of these interpretations have to be true.} Secondly, the dictators' reaction must be consistent with the information they get. This means that the defeats must lead the CPV to either address their lack of popularity -- by responding to public demands or by doubling down on repression and propaganda -- or issue punishment to officials in areas that experienced defeats. Given these two propositions, it is possible to hypothesize in broad strokes certain post-election responses that would be expected under most common theories of authoritarian elections. Figure \ref{fig:Theory} lists out these hypotheses.\footnote{Note that theories that do not conceptualize elections as sources of information \citep[e.g][]{AR2005, Cox2009} do not necessarily predict any reaction to localized defeats.}

Given that authoritarian regimes' post-election reactions to localized defeats are rooted in what information they seek, observing which reactions end up taking place could shed light on dictators' informational goals for the elections. Recalling further that different types of information may suggest different and conflicting courses of actions and thus cannot be sought simultaneously from a same election, it becomes clear that certain reactions to localized defeats may uniquely identify some intentions behind elections, provided that these reactions if observed would contradict other plausible goals that the dictators could have had.

\subsection{The CPV's Response to Central Candidate Defeats}
\label{sec:vietnam_local_defeat}

In the case of Vietnam, what the CPV does in response to the defeats of central candidates in the VNA elections are especially useful in identifying how the party perceives these defeats and consequently what informational goal it had when holding these elections. The reason is that, due to the highly institutionalized and structured nature of Vietnamese politics, the scope of possible actions that the CPV could take following an election is so limited that it would not be able to react to all the incoming information without one reaction compromising the effect of another.

Specifically, if the regime has intended to use the VNA elections to gather information about the distribution of regime popularity, it would see defeats of central candidates as indicators for provinces with faltering public support. The appropriate reaction to this information would be to placate the public with some sort of concession, which would require an \textit{increase} in central transfers from Hanoi to those provinces. In Vietnam, because most provinces spend more money than it can raise through taxes, central transfers are indispensable for local governance, particularly for the provision of public goods. By increasing central transfers, the party leadership enables the provinces in question to invest in programs that directly benefits the public, which is the most straightforward thing it can do to bolster support for the regime.\footnote{Not every regime would see such placation strategy as appropriate for areas with low regime support. As \citet{Magaloni2006} and \citet{Blaydes2008} find in their studies of Mexico and Egypt, for example, the ruling parties actually punish areas with lower ruling party vote share by cutting central transfers to these areas. The difference in context between Vietnam and either Mexico or Egypt is that no organized opposition exists in Vietnam, which means that central candidate defeats reflect only dissatisfaction towards the CPV and not affinity to any particular opposition party. In addition, even in areas with these localized defeats the absolute level of support for the regime is still sufficiently high, such that a sweeping ``punishment regime'' \citep{Magaloni2006} would hurt regime supporters more than it punishes dissidents.  Cross-national evidence by \citet{Miller2015} seems to suggest that authoritarian regimes generally prefer placation strategies such as in Vietnam.}

On the other hand, if the CPV has used elections to evaluate province-level officials, central candidate defeats would reveal the identity of provincial leaders who are either too incompetent or too independent. The CPV should then punish the officials in question with a \textit{decrease} in central transfers. Like in many other authoritarian regimes, corruption opportunity can be seen as a form of compensation by the central government to lower-level officials \citep{Darden2008}. Cutting central transfers reduces the scope for corruption and thus directly affects their income. In addition, it also limits these officials' power by reducing their ability to distribute rent further downwards.\footnote{An implication of this argument is that the election of central candidates at the expense of local candidates can be a negotiated outcome: provinces that are more powerful vis-\`{a}-vis the central government may be able to push for the election of their own candidates and accept the punishment as the cost of doing so. Indeed, \citet{MaleskySchuler2011} find that localized defeats are more likely in provinces that depend less on central transfers.}

For changes in central transfers to reveal the CPV's interpretation of central candidate defeats, it is not necessary that budget adjustments serve as the primary policy instrument for placating the public or punishing regime agents. As long as each goal requires central transfers to be adjusted in a different direction, observing the direction in which central transfers get adjusted would reveal the CPV's preference between these two goals. Indeed, in this case, increasing central transfers would help appease the public, but would also give local officials some means with which to enrich themselves. Similarly, decreasing central transfers would punish local officials but also deepen resentment among local citizens. In other words, if the CPV was indeed altering the flow of transfers to provinces with central candidate defeats, it would be sufficient to confirm that it had chosen to listen to one out of many signals that election results can provide.\footnote{It is of course possible for the regime to make no change to budget allocation and resorts to other policy options, in which case no definite conclusion can be made.}

\section{Empirical Design}
\label{sec:methods}

To analyze whether the CPV increased or decreased central transfers to provinces where localized defeats happen, I apply several different panel data methods on cases of close defeats or victories by central candidates to identify the effect of these localized defeats on the amount of central transfer a province receives.

\subsection{Estimation Methods}
\label{sec:methods_estimation}
I employ in conjunction three different estimation and inference methods. First of all, I leverage the panel structure of the data with a linear fixed effects model:

\begin{equation}
\Delta Y_{it} = \beta D_{it} + \omega T_{i} + \gamma X_{it} + \lambda_i + \delta_t + \epsilon_{it} \label{eq:FE}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta Y_{it}$ is the log of the first difference in net central transfers for province $i$ at time $t$ i.e. $\Delta Y_{it} = \log(Y_{it} - Y_{i, t-1})$, $X_{it}$ is a vector of time-varying covariates, $D_{it}$ marks the treatment status for treated years and $T_{i}$ marks the treatment status for all the years. Specifically, $T_{i}$ takes the value of 1 for every province that experienced local defeat in 2017 and 0 otherwise, and does so for every year in the sample. On the other hand, depending on whether the model seeks to estimate the \textit{instantaneous} effect that occurs in the one year immediately after the election, or the \textit{persistent} effect that manifests in all post-election years, $D_{it}$ is equal to $T_{i}$ for $t=2017$ or $t\geq2017$, and is equal to $0$ otherwise.\footnote{The ``lagged'' treatment indicator accounts for the fact that budget allocation decisions are made at the beginning of each year, such that the effect of the 2016 election only begins to manifest in 2017.} Here, $\lambda_i$ and $\delta_t$ are province and time fixed effects. For all analyses, $t \in \{2012, \cdots, 2018\}$ to exclude the years before the previous election.

Whereas standard fixed effects models are generalization of the difference-in-difference framework, the use of first-differenced outcome here generalizes my model to the triple differences method. Specifically, by allowing potential outcomes to be framed in terms of changes compared to previous years, the model can account for differences in pre-treatment trends across treated and control provinces. It thus relaxes the assumption of parallel trends to one of linear trends, which is much more likely to hold. Typically, models estimating triple differences would require triple interaction terms, but as I show in the Online Appendix, using first-differenced outcomes achieves the same goals. 

Secondly, anticipating problems with inference due to the small sample size, I conduct an additional regression discontinuity analysis using the local randomization approach by \citet{CattaneoTitiunik2015}. The intuition behind it is that, for a small enough window around the treatment assignment threshold, any unit's treatment status can be considered a coin flip from an as-if randomized experiment. This interpretation then allows for exact randomization-based inference methods, which is more appropriate for finite samples. Because randomization inference is done at the candidate level, it also accounts for the possibility that a province may have multiple defeated candidates, or that another may experience both a close win and a defeat. Specifically, after estimating the treatment effect in the observed sample using Model \ref{eq:FE}, I use independent coin flips to re-randomize for $10000$ times election outcomes for each central candidate whose vote margins lie within the window, aggregate the resulting candidate-level treatment status vectors to obtain province-level treatment status vectors, estimate new treatment effects, and then compare the original effect with the distribution of these re-randomized treatment effects.

Finally, to eliminate the problem of dynamic causality \citep{ImaiKim2012}, which arises out of the interdependence between central transfers in pre-election years (past outcomes), central transfers in post-election years (future outcomes), and election results (treatment), I also implement a generalized synthetic control analysis \citep{Xu2017gsynth}. This method improves on the original synthetic control method by \citet{Abadie2010, Abadie2015} by allowing for easy calculation of treatment effects across multiple treated units and the incorporation of fixed effects. The fundamental intuition remains unchanged, however: by using a ``synthetic control'' made from an weighted average of control units to be identical to treated units in terms of pre-treatment outcomes, it is possible for the treated effect to be free from the influence of pre-treatment differences including those from dynamic causality. Additionally, because it neutralizes the effect of previous treatment, the generalized synthetic control method accepts a much longer panel without suffering from the confounding effect of central candidate defeats in previous elections. In particular, I am able to include data from every year between 2004 and 2018, and include as covariates each provinces' histories of central candidate defeats in the 2007 and 2011 elections.

\subsection{Identifying Close Defeats}
\label{sec:methods_sample}

For all these methods, a key empirical problem is that provinces that did experience these defeats may be different from those that did not in ways that matter for central transfers. \citet{MaleskySchuler2011} already show that provinces where defeats happened tend to be more politically independent, in the sense that they raise more income on their own and are located in the South far from Hanoi. This paper's very premise also suggests that they may have less supportive voters or low-quality bureaucrats. At the candidate level, some candidates are also less likely to lose than others: every leader at the highest level, including the Prime Minister, the Party Secretary, and the President, all run in the VNA elections, but the CPV clearly is not going to allow any of them to lose. The provinces these leaders are allocated to can thus be expected to have much lower chance of seeing defeats. 

Drawing insights from the matching methods and from the regression-discontinuity design, I restrict the analysis to provinces where at least one central candidate has won or lose with a margin of no more 10 percentage points.\footnote{I calculate the margin for winning candidates by taking the difference between their vote shares and the bigger between the best-performing losing candidates' vote shares or the 50 percent threshold. Due to Vietnam's electoral rules, this margin can be affected by how each candidate perform vis-\`{a}-vis every other candidate. A similar procedure applies to losing candidates} I use the 10 percentage point margin based on the observation that it is officially considered a low winning threshold by the CPV, such that winning candidates with vote shares below 60 percent are required to formally self-criticize \citep{MaleskySchuler2011}. I also drop from the sample the capital Hanoi and the second biggest municipality Ho Chi Minh City. These steps remove all the provinces where central candidates's \textit{a posteriori} vote share is so large that their \textit{a priori} probability of losing can be inferred to be zero, and leave a set of control group similar enough to the treated group.

Another approach is to achieve as-if randomization at the candidate level. Following \citet{CattaneoTitiunik2015}, I conduct a grid search to identify the upper and lower vote margin boundaries that would produce the largest window within which central candidates who lost and who won are statistically indistinguishable in terms of every pre-treatment candidate-level and district-level characteristics.\footnote{Specifically, I  increment each boundary by $0.25$ at a time to generate a grid of possible windows. For each window, I test the sharp null hypothesis of no treatment effects of defeats on each of the chosen characteristics using the ATE test statistic, and reject any window for which the minimum p-value of these tests is above 0.15. The candidate-level characteristics to be tested include age, gender, party membership, party membership history, education, political power (operationalized following \citet{MaleskySchuler2011}), and the district-level characteristics to be tested include number of candidates and number of available seats.} The resulting window is found to be $(-11.25, 7.75)$. Since the fates of central candidates whose vote shares fell within this window can be assumed to be generated by chance, it is possible to conduct randomization inference by re-randomizing each election outcome independently. As argued by \citet{CattaneoTitiunik2015}, this local randomization approach to what otherwise is a regression-discontinuity setup is suitable for small numbers of treated and control units.

The two approaches produce two slightly different samples, but both achieve remarkable balance. Table \ref{tab:balance} shows the balance between control provinces (without central candidate defeats) and treated provinces (with central candidate defeats) across a number of relevant covariates, all of which are measured in 2015. For both samples, the difference between treatment and control means is subjected to both a randomization-inference based and a standard OLS-based hypothesis test to allay concern about the small sample sizes. As the p-values of both these tests show, treated and control provinces in the first sample are largely similar, except for some minor differences. In addition, even though the second sample is constructed to achieve balance only at the candidate and district levels, the province-level aggregates also display perfect balance across all covariates.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\input{figure/190311_reg_table}

Table \ref{tab:lfe_main} shows the main results from the linear fixed effects model in Section \ref{sec:methods_estimation}. The treatment effect estimates are positive and significant across specifications, and are relatively stable. Given that the outcome variable is the log of first-differenced net transfers, the magnitude of the treatment effect would be best understood as a percentage of the average absolute annual change in net transfers between non-election years. For example, if net transfers to a province have been growing at an average rate of $1000$ billion VND (approximatel US\$4.5 million) per year, then a local defeat would see the province' net transfers in 2017 increased by an additional $128$ to $130$ billion VND, as indicated in the first three column of Table \ref{tab:lfe_main}. When averaged over both 2017 and 2018, the treatment effect is slightly bigger, suggesting that the effect of local defeats on net transfers accumulates over a long duration rather than going away.\footnote{Among the provinces in the sample, Soc Trang experienced the smallest average change in net transfers -- approximately $99$ billion VND per year -- whereas Binh Duong experienced the largest -- approximately \textit{negative} $2602$ billion VND per year. The large and consistent decrease in net transfers reflect the fact that Binh Duong is a net contributor to the national budget, meaning that it turns in more and more of its revenue to the center over years. For net contributors that suffered local defeats, the treatment effect means that these provinces get to keep more of their 2017 and 2018 revenues than they would have been expected to.}

To allay concern about lack of exogeneity, Figure \ref{fig:lfe_placebo} plots the first three estimates in Table \ref{tab:lfe_main} against three placebo treatment effects. The placebo treatment effects are estimated by moving the treatment indicators forward in time as if the election has happened earlier than it actually did. In particular, I estimate three placebo effects for 2013, 2014, and 2015. Because the election could not have left any effect on planned budget by then, the true treatment effects should be zero for these years, and any measured difference between treated and untreated provinces would only reflect imbalance in the data. The results in Figure \ref{fig:lfe_placebo} reassuringly shows no such difference.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

The leftmost plot shows estimates calculated under actual treatment, and the remaining plots show estimates calculated under placebo treatments. In all plots, the error bar shows 95\% confidence intervals.}
	\label{fig:lfe_placebo}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rdd_placebo} presents the results from an analysis based on the local randomization interpretation of the regression discontinuity framework \citep{CattaneoTitiunik2015}. Since statistical inference for this analysis is done using a randomization procedure that does not rely on large sample asymptotics, it is less subjected the small sample concerns that may have cast doubt on the previous results. Reassuringly, the main analysis finds the treatment effect to be statistically similar to those found in Table \ref{tab:lfe_main}. The placebo results suggest that imbalance between treated and untreated provinces are small and close to zero. Some non-zero difference is detected for the 2014 placebo treatments, but it is statistically insignificant.

In all plots, the red line shows the estimated treatment effects, and the gray bar shows their randomization distribution. P-values are presented for the coefficient estimate on the treatment variable.}
	\label{fig:rdd_placebo}
\end{figure}

The absence of statistically significant placebo effects in Table \ref{tab:lfe_main} and Figure \ref{fig:rdd_placebo} suggests little threat of dynamic causality. However, to remain as conservative as possible, I conduct an additional analysis the generalized synthetic control method \cite{Xu2017gsynth} which is particularly effective at addressing dynamic causality. The results, shown graphically in Figure \ref{fig:synth_placebo}, confirm not only a significant and sustained treatment effect for 2017 and 2018, but also the absence of any effect for all three placebo treatments. Again, the magnitude of the treatment effect is consistent with previous results in Table \ref{tab:lfe_main} and Figure \ref{fig:rdd_placebo}.

In all plots, the horizontal dashed line marks the year the election is assigned to have taken place. In the first three plots, treatment effects are calculated from the beginning of the panel to two years after treatment to mimic the actual analysis. In the last plot, treatment effect for 2017 is not calculated to avoid conflating placebo treatment effect with actual treatment effect.}
	\label{fig:synth_placebo}
\end{figure}

Altogether, the three different analyses present a robust and consistent set of findings, according to which the central government in Vietnam increased the amount of central transfers to provinces that suffered defeats of central candidates in the 2016 election. Even though each analysis is not infallible, when combined together each method successfully addresses the problems that face another. The resulting treatment effect is statistically and substantively significant across all specifications, and have survived sufficient placebo tests to be considered causal. It lends credibility to the hypothesis that the CPV leadership considered election setbacks as indicators for areas of low regime support, and chose to remedy this problem by increasing central support to these areas.

\section{Additional Evidence}
\label{sec:additional}

Some additional evidence corroborates further the link between our finding of a significant increase in central transfers to provinces with central candidate defeats and the conclusion that the CPV uses elections to identify areas of abnormally low regime support.

\subsection{Effect of Increased Central Transfers}

The argument in Section \ref{sec:vietnam_local_defeat} requires not only that the CPV increased central transfers to areas it observes weaker regime support, but also that it did so to placate the dissatisfied voting public. For this to happen, the increased flow of money should have been spent on public goods that directly benefit citizens. In addition, there should have been no significant re-allocation of expenditure from items that benefit local officials to those that benefit citizens, or else the net increased in central transfers would still mask a direct punishment to provincial leaders. 

I find evidence to support both propositions by looking at two line items in provincial budget: development spending, which consists mostly of investment on public projects, and administrative spending, which includes from large procurement orders to recurrent expenses such as salaries, travel reimbursements or even office supplies, most of which directly affect the livelihood of provincial bureaucrats. Straightforwardly, an increase in development spending would be evident of a placation strategy towards citizens, whereas cuts in administrative spending would suggest a punishment strategy towards provincial officials. Available data confirms the former, but find no evidence for the latter.

\input{figure/190311_reg_table_mech}

Specifically, Table \ref{tab:lfe_mech} and Figure \ref{fig:synth_rdd_mech} present the above evidence, with the former presenting estimates from linear fixed effects model and the latter showing graphically the results from the local randomization regression discontinuity \citep{CattaneoTitiunik2015} and generalized synthetic control analyses \citep{Xu2017gsynth}. There are positive and stable treatment effects on both outcomes, but only the effect on development spending is statistically significant. Compared to the analyses proposed in Section \ref{sec:methods_estimation}, the only difference is that the linear fixed effects models in this section does not use log-differenced outcome. This is because detailed budget breakdowns are available only for a subset of provinces, and then are sporadically missing for some years. Calculating log-differences would only exacerbate this missingness. This caveat changes the interpretation of the treatment effect's magnitude but does not compromise the analyses' rigor, as every specification still passes all placebo tests (not shown in the interest of space).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

The two top plots show actual instantaneous treatment effects under RDD analyses similar to Table \ref{fig:rdd_placebo}. The two bottom plots show actual treatment effects using the generalized synthetic control method similar to Table \ref{fig:synth_placebo}. Note that only effects for 2017 are calculated due to lack of 2018 data.}
	\label{fig:synth_rdd_mech}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Alternative Mechanisms for Increased Central Transfers}

Another plausible criticism is that the increase in downward flow of money, even if being channeled towards public goods, may not reflect a top-down decision to buy off the public at all, but was instead the result of bottom-up demand. From this perspective, localized defeats led to increased central transfers not because they sent a signal from the provinces to Hanoi, but because each defeated central candidate left a seat for local elites to fill, strengthening the province's representation in the legislature, allowing it to bargain harder for a larger share of the budget. This explanation with characterization of authoritarian legislature as a platform for bargaining between lower-level elites and regime leaders \citep[e.g][]{Magaloni2008}. 

It is possible to rule out this alternative explanation by looking at provinces where central candidate defeats did not translate to additional seats for local candidates i.e. cases where central candidates lost because they failed to clear the 50 percent threshold. In the two provinces of Soc Trang and Can Tho where this happened, because the central candidate still outperformed the closest local competitor, neither ended up winning the election, leaving the province with an unfilled seat and no increased representation. 

Because the generalized synthetic control method allows treatment effects to be extracted for individual units, I show in Figure \ref{fig:synth_mech} that both provinces experienced increased central transfers in 2017 and 2018 when compared to the synthetic control. Although the 95\% confidence intervals are large and cross zero due to insufficient power, the point estimates suggest that both provinces saw large increases in central transfers -- approximately 10\% of previous years' annual change for Soc Trang and nearly 20\% for Can Tho -- following the local defeats there. While this finding is far from conclusive, the direct and magnitude of the effects for Soc Trang and Can Tho does offer some good evidence to dismiss negotiation and bargaining through representation as a driver for the main treatment effects.

	\label{fig:synth_mech}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Absence of Other Punishment}

To further confirm that provincial leaders did not receive punishment for central candidate defeats, I use data on the career tracks of top Vietnamese politicians provided by \citet{MaleskyPhan2017} to see whether these defeats have had any impact on the their career prospects. The data allows me to identify for all officials who have ever governed in a province -- defined as holding one of the top two provincial leadership positions -- whether they have gone on to hold higher positions in the Party and government hierarchies. I conduct only a partial test on provincial officials who were governing before the 2007 and 2011 elections however, because those governing in 2016 would not have completed their current term.

The data, presented in Table \ref{tab:promo_mech}, shows how many among provinces with only narrow central candidate defeats and provinces with only narrow central candidate victories have had zero, one, or both of its two top leaders promoted. Because there could be some shuffling of provincial leadership in the election year, I calculated promotion records for both leaders who are in power \textit{before} and \textit{during} the election year. This would account for both the possibilities that the CPV sees elections as a referendum on either the governing performance or the election management performance of provincial officials. Promotion records are calculated over the entire duration of the term, that is 2006-2010 for those governing in 2005 and 2006, and 2011-2015 for those governing in 2010 and 2011.

\input{figure/190311_table_promo}

Table \ref{tab:promo_mech} shows no significant difference in the frequency of promotion among officials in provinces with central candidate defeats and officials in provinces without central candidate defeats. Where there seems to be a difference, the gap is never big enough for a Fisher's exact test to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, the top party leadership did not delay the promotion of provincial officials even when central candidate defeats had happened under their jurisdiction. This result applies to both leaders who were governing before and leaders who were governing during the election, suggesting that the CPV connected neither governing performance or election management performance to central candidate defeats. 

This finding is also consistent with the observation that, unlike in other nondemocratic regimes such as Russia \citep{Myagkov2009}, Vietnam's leaders rely on punishment much more sparingly, reserving demotion or firing only to very serious transgressions.\footnote{Two illustrative anecdotes suggest that the CPV avoids punishment because it draws attention to disunity within the party, and that it only punishes top officials in case of extreme transgressions. In 2012, when the CPV's highest leadership debated and decided against officially censuring then-PM Nguyen Tan Dung for economic mismanagement, official statements from the Party refers to him only as ``one comrade'' without mentioning any name \citep{voa2012}. Later, in 2017, when the Party's leaders finally decided to punish Ho Chi Minh City's Party Secretary Dinh La Thang and to publicly acknowledge this decision, it was only after mismanagement of PetroVietnam, Vietnam's largest SOE and where Thang had served as chairman between 2009 and 2001, has been found to cost the country close to US\$150 million \citep{BBC2017}.} In addition, the CPV only makes major personnel decisions at its Party Congress, which takes place every five year and usually just before an election (presumably so that the election could ratify and legitimize newly appointed leaders). This make the time lag between one election's outcomes and the next batch of promotion decisions too large for the latter to be used as punishment for the former. Ultimately, if budget allocation is better suited than personnel decisions for punishing officials responsible for central candidate defeats, but neither of them was used for this purpose, it is only plausible that the CPV was not engaging in punishment at all.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

The thriving literature on authoritarian institutions in general and authoritarian elections in particular have identified a number of governance goals that elections can achieve for authoritarian rulers, many of which center around elections' ability to provide information on variables that dictators cannot access easily. Left unconsidered by this literature, however, is the reality that each authoritarian regime can only seek and receive a limited amount of information from elections, no matter how many different signals these elections can emit. Indeed, dictators seeking too many different types of information risk facing dissonance from the potentially conflicting information and contradictory policy recommendation. As a result, authoritarian rulers are expected to avoid such multitasking, and instead should focus each election towards a limited number of prioritized information goals.

To identify which type of information each dictator chooses to collect from elections, outside observers may begin by noting which possible determinants of election results are left uncontrolled by the dictator, but much greater inferential leverage can be gained by paying attention to the dictator's post-election responses when faced with surprising localized defeat. These responses are informative because they are tied to the authoritarian ruler's interpretation of localized defeats, namely what they believe to have caused these defeats; this interpretation in turn must be motivated by the original informational purpose. In other words, dictators see in elections what they seek to see, and react based on what they see.

The case of Vietnam's National Assembly elections in 2016 demonstrates well this logic. Even though they preside over a highly capable single-party regime, the Communist Party of Vietnam still faces serious information problems, in particular when it comes to knowing where in the country it enjoys weaker public support and who among its high-level agents are less reliable. Initial observation suggests that the national legislative elections may have been designed to provide information on either of these variables, but does not discern whether the Party has any preference for any type of information over the other. Focusing on a rare set of localized defeats, specifically defeats by candidates particularly preferred by the central leadership, it becomes clear that the Hanoi leadership can pursue only one type of information: either it seeks to learn about the geographic distribution of regime popularity and considers such defeats evidence of low support areas, or it hopes to evaluate its agents' performance and attributes the defeats to the incompetence or disloyalty of province-level officials who are in charge of election management. Each of these two interpretations would produce a different policy recommendation, but in the context of Vietnam the two recommendations are diametrically opposite: the first interpretation would call for placating the voting public through increased central transfers to provinces where defeats happen, whereas the second would suggest punishing the weak officials by cutting transfers to the same provinces.

A combination of different empirical approaches finds that Vietnam's leaders increased central transfers to provinces they has suffered localized defeats in, thereby confirming that these leaders sought and thus saw in these defeats only signals about regime popularity. Additional evidence further shows that the increased transfers were indeed used towards development expenditure, and were offered without upwards push by elected legislators. This is consistent with the idea that Hanoi used this signal to identify pockets of dissatisfied citizens to placate. Moreover, officials in provinces with defeats did not experience any other form of punishment, suggesting that the Party did not see the results as informative about regime agent competence or loyalty, despite their apparent needs for this information and the election's ability to provide it. 

As in all projects that focus on specific country cases, our findings may not generalize well to countries beyond Vietnam. However, at the very least this paper has contributed an empirical framework against which theories of authoritarian institutions could be tested. Moreover, some of its results are interesting \textit{because} it comes from Vietnam. If the leaders of this strong, highly institutionalized, single-party regime, even with all the power needed to consistently command near-perfect election results, still cannot satisfy all their information needs by holding authoritarian elections, then perhaps there really is an upper limit to how much elections and other authoritarian institutions could assist the dictators of the world. In addition, the Vietnamese regime's response to localized defeats even when these defeats pose only non-existential threat suggests that autocrats can and do respond to public dissatisfaction. This echoes other findings in the literature that even formal authoritarian institutions may offer pathways to accountability \citep[e.g.][]{Miller2015,Lorentzen2013,Manion2014}, but calls into questions existing claims that autocrats pay more attention to governing their own subordinates than to keeping citizens content \citep[e.g.][]{Svolik2012}.

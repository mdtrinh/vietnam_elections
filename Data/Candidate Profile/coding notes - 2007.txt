variables that can be done with code:
minority
religion_any
degree
party_years
party_yearsentrance
party
years_party
incumbencyterms
locallegislature (note: original var does not make distinction between HDND tinh? and HDND huyen.)
politburo (note: add Nong Duc Manh)
partysecratariat (note: Malesky's data misses Ho Duc Viet)
centralcommittee (maybe...)
localpartysecretariat (note: make distinction between tinh? uy? and huyen. uy?, Malesky's data looks only at tinh? uy?)
localpcom (note: Malesky's data seems haphazard - should restrict only to provincial level)
business (note: Malesky's data includes "quan? doc'" or "cong nhan"

variables that will be calculated
centralnominated

other variables are deemed irrelevant for now...


note: Nguyen Van Tien was added to Tien Giang 2 (? - not included in original list but was elected regardless)

note: for candidates_district, Malesky coded this variable from candidates_seat, which measure the ratio of candidates over *number of elected candidates*. Candidates_seat should actually be candidates over *number of available seats*, since in 2 districts 3 were inteded to win but only 2 did. Malesky's candidates_district variable missed all of this.

note: for power_total, the total in a district seems to be sum(power) + 1 i.e. even after accounting for all the variables, each district total is still larger than calculated total by 1

- Cannot verify completely the cases, but based on official sources we know the composition of the 182 central nominees as to who the nominators are. We manage to get them quite close. Note that Nguyen Van Giau and Nguyen Sinh Hung are assigned as national assembly according to one of the sources. We still have one Government nominee too many and one National Assembly nominee too few.
